**Description**: DISEASES is a weekly updated web resource that integrates evidence on disease-gene associations  from automatic text mining, manually curated literature, cancer mutation data, and  genome-wide association studies. We further unify the evidence by assigning confidence  scores that facilitate comparison of the different types and sources of evidence.
