**Knowledge Level**: mixed
  
**Agent Type**: not_provided

**Description**: TISSUES is a weekly updated web resource that integrates evidence on tissue expression  from manually curated literature, proteomics and transcriptomics screens, and automatic  text mining. We map all evidence to common protein identifiers and Brenda Tissue Ontology  terms, and further unify it by assigning confidence scores that facilitate comparison of  the different types and sources of evidence. We finally visualize these scores on a  schematic human body to provide a convenient overview.
