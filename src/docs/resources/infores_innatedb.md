**Description**: InnateDB is a publicly available database of the genes, proteins, experimentally-verified interactions  and signaling pathways involved in the innate immune response of humans, mice and bovines to microbial infection.  The database captures an improved coverage of the innate immunity interactome by integrating known interactions  and pathways from major public databases together with manually-curated data into a centralised resource.
