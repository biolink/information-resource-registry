# information-resource-registry

The information resource registry is a listing of data sources present in the NCATS Data Translator system.  
Each information resource has an identifier, a short description, and a URL to more information about that 
resource.

Explore the intricate relationships between data sources and aggregators in [this detailed Sankey diagram](data_flow_diagram.md). 
The visualization provides a clear representation of how specific datasets are consumed by various data 
integration platforms, illustrating the flow and interdependence of information within the ecosystem. 
By examining these connections, researchers and data professionals can gain insights into the provenance 
and utilization of key resources, enhancing their understanding of data interoperability.
